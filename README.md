# Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of past and current projects that I have worked on at work or just for fun.

Before we get going, I would love to hear from you.  Let's connect at [linkedin.com/tom-ward](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-ward-1b7956135/).

## Projects

AB Testing is a critical method for optimizing web conversions through statistical analysis.  In this project, I present the basic concepts of Bayesian statistics (such as the prior, liklihood, posterior, beta distribution, etc), compare it to the more traditional frequentist approach, and present the code necessary both to run an AB test and output a variety of graphs that help visualizing the results.
